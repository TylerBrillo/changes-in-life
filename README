College is a new dimension for me. Everything will change. I consider college as path to my success and I am scared to face it. I saw a place of different people, some are strict and some are mean. Also because of college, I found myself in a new environment. Like a new Mary Tyler Brillo was born. College gave me new roles, new routines, new relationship, new assumptions and many new things to explore and learn. College life serves as a stepping stone to me. Many roles, but I will all start to be a responsible daughter. Responsible daughter that will follow orders such as curfew, not lazy, study study and study. New student because Csb is not high school that you can just goof around. Csb has its own rules that are well followed.  New character, a fresh start, no words that she is like that-like that.  New routines—CSB is located in Taft were too far from our house and no service that will fetch me. New places I have discover like DLSU is just in front. I could ride any like bus, lrt or even jeepney. New relationship is a big challenge to me, new administration to follow, no teachers anymore—but professors, new kind of classmates and new found love. New assumptions, I just want a successful life and career. Make my life useful and help those who helped me from the start. Give thanks for all the years helping me survive this cruel life and have a family too.
